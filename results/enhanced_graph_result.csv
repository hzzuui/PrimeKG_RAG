It works by The exact mechanism of action of CBD and THC is not currently fully understood. However, it is known that CBD acts on cannabinoid (CB) receptors of the endocannabinoid system, which are found in numerous areas of the body, including the peripheral and central nervous systems, including the brain. The endocannabinoid system regulates many physiological responses of the body including pain, memory, appetite, and mood. More specifically, CB1 receptors can be found within the pain pathways of the brain and spinal cord where they may affect CBD-induced analgesia and anxiolysis, and CB2 receptors have an effect on immune cells, where they may affect CBD-induced anti-inflammatory processes. .

Indication: When used in combination with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol as the product Sativex, cannabidiol was given a standard marketing authorization (ie. a Notice of Compliance (NOC)) by Health Canada for the following indications: .', 'Stiripentol is used to treat developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. It works by Stiripentol enhances GABAergic inhibition and prolongs the open duration of GABA-A receptor chloride channels by a barbiturate-like mechanism. It binds to GABA-A receptors containing any of the α, β, γ, or δ-subunits but displays strongest potency when bound to receptors containing α3 or δ subunits. Stiripentol is an inhibitor of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which plays a physiological role in energy metabolism of neurons and regulation of neuronal excitation. It binds to the site separate from lactate and pyruvate binding sites of the enzyme and inhibits both pyruvate-to-lactate conversion and lactate-to-pyruvate conversion. LDH inhibitors including stiripentol as antiepileptic treatments mimic ketogenic diet, where the energy source in the brain is switched from glucose to mainly ketone bodies. The ketone bodies directly regulate neuronal excitation and seizures via ATP-sensitive potassium channels and vesicular glutamate transporters. As a potent inhibitor of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, mainly CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, stiripentol co-administration with other antiepileptic drugs elevates the free unchanged active drugs (such as carbamazepine, sodium valproate, phenytoin, phenobarbital and many benzodiazepines) in the circulation to mediate their therapeutic actions. .

Indication: Indicated for use in conjunction with clobazam and valproate as adjunctive therapy of refractory generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (SMEI, Dravet’s syndrome) whose seizures are not adequately controlled with clobazam and valproate..', 'Vigabatrin is used to treat developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. It works by Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory transmitter throughout the central nervous system, and the potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission is therefore a crucial mechanism through which antiepileptic agents may combat the pathologic excitatory neurotransmission seen in epilepsy. Vigabatrin increases concentrations of GABA in the central nervous system by irreversibly inhibiting the enzymes responsible for its metabolism to succinic semialdehyde: gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T). .

Indication: Vigabatrin is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of refractory complex partial seizures in patients 2 years of age and older who have had inadequate responses to multiple previous treatments (i.e. not to be used for first-line therapy). It is also indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of infantile spasms in patients between 1 month and 2 years of age for whom the potential benefits outweigh the risk of vision loss..', 'Chlorpromazine is used to treat mental disorder, targeting gene CALM1. It works by Chlorpromazine acts as an antagonist (blocking agent) on different postsysnaptic receptors -on dopaminergic-receptors (subtypes D1, D2, D3 and D4 - different antipsychotic properties on productive and unproductive symptoms), on serotonergic-receptors (5-HT1 and 5-HT2, with anxiolytic, antidepressive and antiaggressive properties as well as an attenuation of extrapypramidal side-effects, but also leading to weight gain, fall in blood pressure, sedation and ejaculation difficulties), on histaminergic-receptors (H1-receptors, sedation, antiemesis, vertigo, fall in blood pressure and weight gain), alpha1/alpha2-receptors (antisympathomimetic properties, lowering of blood pressure, reflex tachycardia, vertigo, sedation, hypersalivation and incontinence as well as sexual dysfunction, but may also attenuate pseudoparkinsonism - controversial) and finally on muscarinic (cholinergic) M1/M2-receptors (causing anticholinergic symptoms like dry mouth, blurred vision, obstipation, difficulty/inability to urinate, sinus tachycardia, ECG-changes and loss of memory, but the anticholinergic action may attenuate extrapyramidal side-effects)..

It works by Excitation of cardiac muscle involves the activation of a slow calcium inward current that is induced by L-type slow calcium channels, which are voltage-sensitive, ion-selective channels associated with a high activation threshold and slow inactivation profile. L-type calcium channels are the main current responsible for the late phase of the pacemaker potential. Acting as the main Ca2+ source for contraction in smooth and cardiac muscle, activation of L-type calcium channels allows the influx of calcium ions into the muscles upon depolarization and excitation of the channel. It is proposed that this cation influx may also trigger the release of additional calcium ions from intracellular storage sites. Diltiazem is a slow calcium channel blocker that binds to the extracellular site of the alpha-1C subunit of the channel, which is thought to be the S5-6 linker region of the transmembrane domain IV and/or S6 segment of domain III. Diltiazem can get access to this binding site from either the intracellular or extracellular side, but it requires a voltage-induced conformational changes in the membrane. Diltiazem inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes. In isolated human atrial and ventricular myocardium, diltiazem suppressed tension over the range of membrane potentials associated with calcium channel activity but had little effect on the tension-voltage relations at more positive potentials. This effect is thought to be mediated by the voltage-dependent block of the L-type calcium channels and inhibition of calcium ion release from the ER stores, without altering the sodium-calcium coupled transport or calcium sensitivity of myofilaments. Through inhibition of inward calcium current, diltiazem exerts a direct ionotropic and energy sparing effect on the myocardium. Diltiazem fslows atrioventricular nodal conduction, which is due to its ability to impede slow channel function..

It works by Verapamil inhibits L-type calcium channels by binding to a specific area of their alpha-1 subunit,Cav1.2, which is highly expressed on L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle and myocardial tissue where these channels are responsible for the control of peripheral vascular resistance and heart contractility. Calcium influx through these channels allows for the propagation of action potentials necessary for the contraction of muscle tissue and the heart's electrical pacemaker activity. Verapamil binds to these channels in a voltage- and frequency-dependent manner, meaning affinity is increased 1) as vascular smooth muscle membrane potential is reduced, and 2) with excessive depolarizing stimulus. .

It works by Vision:Vitamin A (all-<i>trans</i> retinol) is converted in the retina to the 11-<i>cis</i>-isomer of retinaldehyde or 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal. 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal functions in the retina in the transduction of light into the neural signals necessary for vision. 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal, while attached to opsin in rhodopsin is isomerized to all-<i>trans</i>-retinal by light. This is the event that triggers the nerve impulse to the brain which allows for the perception of light. All-<i>trans</i>-retinal is then released from opsin and reduced to all-<i>trans</i>-retinol. All-<i>trans</i>-retinol is isomerized to 11-<i>cis</i>-retinol in the dark, and then oxidized to 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal. 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal recombines with opsin to re-form rhodopsin. Night blindness or defective vision at low illumination results from a failure to re-synthesize 11-<i>cis</i> retinal rapidly. <br/>Epithelial differentiation: The role of Vitamin A in epithelial differentiation, as well as in other physiological processes, involves the binding of Vitamin A to two families of nuclear retinoid receptors (retinoic acid receptors, RARs; and retinoid-X receptors, RXRs). These receptors function as ligand-activated transcription factors that modulate gene transcription. When there is not enough Vitamin A to bind these receptors, natural cell differentiation and growth are interrupted..

Indication: For the treatment of vitamin A deficiency..', 'Ascorbic acid is contraindicated for sarcoidosis. It works by In humans, an exogenous source of ascorbic acid is required for collagen formation and tissue repair by acting as a cofactor in the posttranslational formation of 4-hydroxyproline in -Xaa-Pro-Gly- sequences in collagens and other proteins. Ascorbic acid is reversibly oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid in the body. These two forms of the vitamin are believed to be important in oxidation-reduction reactions.

L-type calcium channels are the main current responsible for the late phase of the pacemaker potential. Acting as the main Ca2+ source for contraction in smooth and cardiac muscle, activation of L-type calcium channels allows the influx of calcium ions into the muscles upon depolarization and excitation of the channel.

It works by The effects of ziprasidone are differentiated from other antispychotics based on its preference and affinity for certain receptors. Ziprasidone binds to serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) and dopamine D2 receptors in a similar fashion to other atypical antipsychotics; however, one key difference is that ziprasidone has a higher 5-HT2A/D2 receptor affinity ratio when compared to other antipsychotics such as olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole. Ziprasidone offers enhanced modulation of mood, notable negative symptom relief, overall cognitive improvement and reduced motor dysfunction which is linked to it's potent interaction with 5-HT2C, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT1A receptors in brain tissue. Ziprasidone can bind moderately to norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake sites which may contribute to its antidepressant and anxiolytic activity. Patient's taking ziprasidone will likely experience a lower incidence of orthostatic hypotension, cognitive disturbance, sedation, weight gain, and disruption in prolactin levels since ziprasidone has a lower affinity for histamine H1, muscarinic M1, and alpha1-adrenoceptors. .
